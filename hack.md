1.  Problem Statement: 
Interactive  Financial  Literacy  &  Fraud  Awareness  Tool  for  Holistic  Personal 
Finance Education. 
 
2.  Challenges/issues: 
Many  customers  lack  a  strong  understanding  of  personal  finance  fundamentals, 
leading to poor financial decisions, missed opportunities for wealth management, and 
increased vulnerability to fraud. 
Financial literacy remains a critical gap in customer knowledge, with many individuals 
struggling  to  grasp  core  personal  finance  concepts  such  as  budgeting,  saving, 
investing,  and  tax  planning.  This  deficiency  often  leads  to  poor  financial  decisions, 
underutilization  of  financial  tools,  and  increased  debt.  In  parallel,  the  growing 
complexity  of  digital  financial  platforms  has  made  consumers  more  susceptible  to 
fraud, including phishing attacks, identity theft, and social engineering scams. 
 
The common frauds, are such as  
 Ponzi  schemes:  Fraudulent  investment  operations  paying  returns  to 
earlier investors with new investors' money. 
 Pyramid schemes: Recruiting members who pay fees to join, with returns 
based on enrolling others rather than actual product sales. 
 Identity theft: Stealing personal information to commit fraud or theft. 
 Credit card fraud: Unauthorised use of credit card information to make 
purchases or withdraw funds. 
 Phishing scams: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by 
pretending to be a trustworthy entity. 
 Investment fraud: Deceptive practices to convince individuals to invest 
in worthless or non-existent opportunities. 
 Mortgage  fraud:  Misrepresenting  information  to  obtain  a  mortgage  or 
better terms dishonestly. 
 Tax  scams:  Fake  schemes  promising  large  refunds  or  reduced  tax 
liabilities through false claims. 
 Lottery and sweepstakes fraud: Telling victims they've won prizes but 
must pay fees upfront to claim them. 
 Charity scams: Fake charities soliciting donations for causes that don't 
exist or benefit the fraudster. 
 Debt relief scams: Promising to eliminate or reduce debt for upfront fees 
without delivering results. 
 Fake  check  scams:  Sending  counterfeit  checks  and  asking  victims  to 
send money back before the check bounces.

 Online banking fraud: Hacking or tricking individuals to gain access to 
their online bank accounts. 
 Employment  fraud:  Fake  job  offers  requiring  payment  for  training  or 
materials that never lead to real employment. 
 Student  loan  scams:  Fraudulent  companies  promising  to  reduce  or 
erase student loan debt for upfront fees.
