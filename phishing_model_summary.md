‚úÖ FULL SUMMARY OF YOUR app.py:
- Flask app with CORS.
- Loads RandomForestClassifier from phishing_model.pkl.
- Extracts features: URL length, subdomains, SSL cert, WHOIS age, special chars, suspicious keywords, suspicious TLD, IP presence.
- Computes rule-based and ML-based phishing probabilities.
- Flags URL as phishing if combined probability > 30%.
- Test endpoints and a sample inflation prediction API.

üß™ HOW TO IMPROVE THE MODEL TO CATCH TRICKY URLs LIKE localhost.evil.com:
- Add subdomain analysis: number of subdomains, specific patterns (e.g., 'localhost' used as subdomain).
- Compare subdomain/domain to known brands using string similarity (Levenshtein).
- Add detection of punycode/unicode tricks.
- Adjust rule-based score: penalize suspicious subdomains.
- Include tricky samples like 'localhost.evil.com' or 'secure-paypal.com.evil.xyz' as phishing in dataset.

üèó HOW TO RETRAIN:
1. Collect more data with tricky phishing URLs.
2. Define new features: subdomain patterns, similarity to brands.
3. Prepare dataset:
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv('new_dataset.csv')
   X = df[['url_length', 'special_chars', 'domain_age', ...]]
   y = df['label']
4. Train model:
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
   model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
   model.fit(X, y)
5. Save model:
   import joblib
   joblib.dump(model, 'phishing_model.pkl')
6. Replace existing phishing_model.pkl in Flask app.
